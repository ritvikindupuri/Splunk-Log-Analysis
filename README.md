# Splunk SIEM: SOC Analyst Threat Hunt & Log Analysis

This project demonstrates a comprehensive security analysis within a Splunk Cloud environment built from scratch. Acting as a SOC Tier-1 Analyst, I ingested and analyzed over 100,000 events from the "Buttercup Games" e-commerce dataset to perform two distinct investigations: a security-focused **threat hunt** for a potential brute-force attack and an operations-focused **web traffic analysis**.

## Investigation 1: Threat Hunting for Brute-Force Activity

The primary security objective was to identify unauthorized access attempts against critical infrastructure within the simulated environment.

### Methodology
I used Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL) to systematically filter the log data. The hunt began with broad queries and was progressively narrowed down using host, source, and keyword filters to isolate suspicious events. The investigation focused on identifying patterns of failed logins, a key indicator of a brute-force attack.

### Findings & Visualization
The investigation successfully identified over **100 failed SSH login attempts** for the `root` account targeting the `mail.sv` host. The `secure.log` was isolated as the primary data source. By creating a timechart visualization, I was able to observe the pattern of failed attempts over time, confirming a concentrated brute-force attempt.

## Investigation 2: Web Traffic & Operational Analysis

To demonstrate versatility, I conducted a secondary analysis on the web access logs from the same dataset. This involved identifying operational issues and potential sources of malicious web scanning.

### HTTP Error Analysis
By filtering for HTTP 4xx/5xx status codes, I was able to identify which pages were generating "Not Found" errors and which user agents (clients/bots) were responsible for the highest volume of these errors. This type of analysis is crucial for both identifying broken links and detecting scanners looking for vulnerabilities.

### Business Intelligence
The same SIEM data can be pivoted to provide business insights. I queried the dataset for vendor sales logs to identify trends and top-performing vendors within the e-commerce platform.
